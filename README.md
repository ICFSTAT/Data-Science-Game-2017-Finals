# Data Science Game 2017 Finals
This is the corrected version of my best local submission during the finals. I was getting overfitted and I suspected there was an error in my code , even I improved my local score but the result in the leaderboard was getting worse and due to feeling of nervousness  I could not figure out where the error was in my code . After the finals, I felt more relaxed and I realised where the error was, then I corrected it and the results and leaderboard are 10.85273 in public and in 10.30286 private. This model has a lot of room to improve, if I had detected the error on time, I could have made more feature engineering, some ensembling and maybe get a top solution.

My approach is simple: In the validation set of Kaggle, I had to predict the demand for three future months with respect to training data. So the predictors have to be information at least three months before the transaction. Then I added moving averages, accumulated means for the most import variables, and former values of the target for different combinations of SalOrg and Material. Finally, I used lightgbm with some parameters with the aim of reducing the variance.
