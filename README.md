# Data Science Game 2017 Finals
This is the corrected version of my best local submission during the finals. Due to feeling of nervousness, I could not figure out where the error was in my code and was getting overfitted. After the finals, I felt more relaxed and I realised where the error was, then I corrected it and the results and leaderboard are 10.85273 in public and in 10.30286 private. This model has a lot of room to improve, if I had detected the error on time, I could have made more feature engineering, some ensembling and maybe get a top solution.
